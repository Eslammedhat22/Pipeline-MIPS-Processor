the GUI immediately assembles the instructions into a machine code that is displayed on the right also stores it in a text file named ”inst_mem.txt”
-       double click on assembler.exe
-	you must put it in the same directory as the inst_mem you are going to use.
-	if you want to use a label for beq,bne,j,jal you need to put the instruction in the same line of the label. don’t leave the label line empty it won’t work,
        if the label in the end of assembly code you must put in sll $zero,$zero,0 in the same line of label  for example (Exit:  => false , Exit: sll $zero,$zero,0  =>true) 
-	also don’t leave empty lines
-	there’s a debugging button (OFF by default) click on it to turn it ON to see the instruction fields in decimal numbers
-	don’t use nop as it isn’t supported instead use sll $zero,$zero,0


test cases are provided inside the gui report


/////////////////new feature in the gui//////////////////////
the ability to see the output
1)the verilog file should be named cpu.v and be in the same path as assembler.exe
2)close modelsim
3)all other text files "inst_mem.txt" "data_mem.txt" "reg_f.txt" should be in the same path as assembler.exe
4)put your assembly instructions and click run  it'll show the results.
5)to edit the code again click edit
6)it uses the initial values stored in "data_mem.txt" "reg_f.txt"

take care : the gui set simulation time =300ns if you want to run instructions take more than 300ns , you should run and see the result in modelsim simulation
